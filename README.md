  page: '/editor'
});

// Track AI suggestions
await tracker.trackAISuggestion('accepted', {
  suggestionId: 'sug-123',
  type: 'accessibility'
});

// Start content editing session
const sessionId = await tracker.startContentEditingSession('block-123');
```

### Theme Builder API

```typescript
import { ThemeBuilder } from './lib/themeBuilder';

const customTheme = ThemeBuilder.create('My Theme')
  .setColors({
    primary: '#ff6b6b',
    background: '#ffffff'
  })
  .setTypography({
    fontFamily: '"Roboto", sans-serif'
  })
  .build();

// Apply theme
applyTheme(customTheme);
```

### Voice Navigation API

```typescript
import { useVoiceNavigation } from './lib/voiceNavigation';

const commands = [
  { command: 'save', action: () => saveContent(), description: 'Save content' },
  { command: 'publish', action: () => publishContent(), description: 'Publish content' }
];

const { startListening, speak } = useVoiceNavigation(commands);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Voice Navigation Not Working**
   - Ensure microphone permissions are granted
   - Check browser compatibility (Chrome, Edge, Safari)
   - Verify SSL certificate for HTTPS requirement

2. **Theme Not Applying**
   - Clear browser cache and localStorage
   - Check CSS custom property support
   - Verify theme JSON structure

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Run performance dashboard to identify bottlenecks
   - Check bundle analyzer for large dependencies
   - Enable code splitting and lazy loading

4. **Deployment Failures**
   - Verify environment variables
   - Check build logs for errors
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
